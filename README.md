# CS577-algorithm
This course is the core CS undergrad course about algorithm, topics include (Update weekly):
- Basic background from discrete math.
- Graphs and related algothm. BFS/DFS(O(m+n)).
- Greedy algorithms. ALways stays ahead and exchange argument techniques. Dijkstra's method.
- More greedy. Minimun spanning tree. Kruskal's algorithm; Prim's algorithm; Reverse-Kruskal's algorithm. Paging problem.
- Divide and Conquer. Recursion.
- Dynamic programming.
