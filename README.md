# CS577-algorithm

Please see this [link](https://oliverxuzy.github.io/cs577) to view coding question directly.

This course is the core CS undergrad course about algorithm, topics include (Update weekly):
- Basic background from discrete math.
- Graphs and related algothm. BFS/DFS(O(m+n)).
- Greedy algorithms. ALways stays ahead and exchange argument techniques. Dijkstra's method.
- More greedy. Minimun spanning tree. Kruskal's algorithm; Prim's algorithm; Reverse-Kruskal's algorithm. Paging problem.
- Divide and Conquer. Recursion.
- Dynamic programming. Bellman equation + solution martix. Different kinds of problems.
- Network Flow. FF algorithm(refined greedy). All the problems reduced to max-flow problem.
- Computational Intractability. Problem reductions. P, NP, NP complete, NP hard.
