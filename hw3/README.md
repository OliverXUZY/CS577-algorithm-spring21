# HW3: Greedy algorithm
## Coding question: Interval scheduling: Finish first
- I learned greedy algorithm in this week, and two techniques: Stays ahead and exchange argument.
- I use java to implement coding question, I found java do not have off-thte-shelf sorting function as python. I needed to construct class implement comparators(with override).
But I learned it in cs300 in following week.
